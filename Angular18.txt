Angular 18 new features
1. Zoonless Change Detection : It is still under experimental phase. 
	Features: 
	- Faster initial rendering and faster runtime
	- smaller bundle size, faster page loads
	- simpler debugging
	- native async/await 

	bootstrapApplication(App, {
  providers: [
    provideExperimentalZonelessChangeDetection()
  ]
});

2. Signals is now stable
3. Deferrable views are stable
Also known as @defer which is used to reduce the initial bundle size of the application or defer heavy components.
Requirements:
- Component should be standalone

4. Built-in control flow is stable
=> @if
	feature: referencing the complex condition in the @if block by adding as <variableName> just after the condition
	ex : @if(user.profile.settings.startDate; as startDate){ 
		{{startDate}}
	}
=> @for: 
  Features:
  -it also has track property, 
  - few variables like ($count, $index, $first, $last, $event, $odd) are available always inside the loop
  - fallback for @for block with @empty block just after ending the @for block.
  Ex: 	@for(let item of items; track item.it; let idx = $index, e = $event) {
			<p> Item #{{idx}}: {{item.name}}</p>
		} @empty {
			<p> There are no items.</p>
		}
  
=> @switch: it does not have a fallthrough thus break or return statement is not needed

ex: @switch(userPermission) {
		@case ('admin') {
			<app-admin-dashboard/>
		}
		@case ('editor') {
		<app-editor-dashboard/>
		}
		@default {
			<app-viewer-dashboard/>
		}
	}
5. Fallback content for ng-content

6. Unified control state change events
FormControl, FormGroup and FormArray can now use events can do necessary task on touch state, pristine status and control status.
